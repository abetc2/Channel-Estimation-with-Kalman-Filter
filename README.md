# Channel-Estimation-with-Kalman-Filter
A channel estimation with Kalman Filter is defined in this code. Also DFT based channel estimation is implied to improve the results. 

The paper that is used when writing code is: Yuanjin, Zheng. "A novel channel estimation and tracking method for wireless OFDM systems based on pilots and Kalman filtering." IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics 49.2 (2003): 275-283.

To use code just running is enough. After running two plots will be obtained.
This plots are bit error rate of the data and mean square error of the channel estimation.
